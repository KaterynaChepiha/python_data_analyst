# python_data_analyst
<b>Description:</b> As a Data Analyst, I created a Power BI dashboard for analyzing employee data using SQL and Python. The dashboard included key reports such as Employee Average Salary by Department, Employee Count by Department, Total Salary by Department, and Employee Count by Zip Code. By combining SQL for data extraction and Python for dynamic visualizations, I enabled stakeholders to interact with the data through filters, providing insights that supported workforce and compensation decisions. This project demonstrated my ability to integrate Python, SQL, and Power BI for effective data analysis and visualization.
